\section{Summary}
Software Engineer, with more than 10 years of experience in software development in a wide range of systems 
such as Backend applications, Websites, Ecommerces, Embedded applications, High Scalability Service API and
others.

\medskip I have participated in large projects that have given me the opportunity to gain extensive knowledge of various new
technologies and be involved in the complete life cycle of the software development process, including requirements
gathering and definition, functional analysis, prototyping, proof of concept, design, implementation, testing,
maintenance, bugs management, knowledge transfer, leading task driven teams of developers, and training new
developers.

\medskip I would like to be considered as an enthusiastic, proactive, independent engineer with great communication skills
and good interpersonal-leadership abilities. Also as an Agile Methodologies promoter.
