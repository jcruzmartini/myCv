technologies and be involved in the complete life cycle of the software development process, including requirements
gathering and definition, functional analysis, prototyping, proof of concept, design, implementation, testing,
maintenance, bugs management, knowledge transfer, leading task driven teams of developers, and training new
developers.

\medskip Currently I am leading and developing with an inter cultural and multi country based group of 14 people including front and backend developers and QA.
